# Sensors
Assignment 1 for CAP4053

- Please be sure to change the working directory to ...Sensors/core/assets before running
- In the Intellij IDEA, you just have to go to Run->Edit Configurations->Working Directory
- Before you can change the working directory, you have to add a new configuration (application)
- Make the working directory your full path to the assets folder

Here is the tutorial I was following

- By using the application state manager, each state will have its own update and render functions
- This makes it easier to only update the logic for the current state

A friend of mine suggested this tutorial, but I have to looked at it yet
